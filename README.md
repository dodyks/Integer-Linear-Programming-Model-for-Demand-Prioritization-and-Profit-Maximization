## ðŸ“Œ Background of the SME: Delirum Originals Store

Delirum Originals Store is a small and medium enterprise (SME) in the fashion sector, established in January 2013. Specializing in a made-to-order production system, it offers a wide range of customizable products, including T-shirts, polo shirts, jackets, event uniforms, and other personalized fashion items to meet individual customer preferences. This flexible production concept supports product exclusivity and ensures relevance to rapidly changing market trends.

Despite the growing demand, Delirum Originals Store faces common challenges in the garment SME sector: limited production capacity, varying production times across different products, and fluctuating orders that often exceed production capabilities. With only 10 workers and a capacity of 350â€“400 units per week, the store struggles to meet daily demands reaching 450â€“500 units, resulting in delivery delays of up to two weeks. These delays risk lowering customer satisfaction and damaging the reputation of the business as a reliable made-to-order provider.

Moreover, SMEs like Delirum Originals Store play a strategic role in Indonesiaâ€™s economy, contributing significantly to national GDP. However, local garment SMEs remain vulnerable in the face of fierce competition from cheap imported products. This situation highlights the critical need for effective production optimization strategies to ensure efficiency and long-term business sustainability in an increasingly competitive market.
